About  
=====
This is a scons builder for Google's protocol buffers. In its current configuration, it should
be instantly deployable into a site_scons directory or similar. (ie: anywhere on scons' tool path)

Heavily based on the one located on the (http://scons.org/wiki/ProtocBuilder)[Scons wiki] written by Scott Stafford.

Java support and explicit output language interface added by Steven Haywood.
